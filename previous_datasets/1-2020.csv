49078,"Tuesday night ’ s Democratic debate was marked by an ever-widening schism between long-time ‘ friends ’ turned rivals , Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , which culminated in a spurned handshake which has become the talk of Twitter .
The talking match was punctuated by several increasingly tense and bitter exchanges between the pair as the night wore on .
Roughly 45 minutes into the discussion , CNN moderator Abby Phillip asked Sanders to respond to reports he told Warren that a woman couldn ’ t win the 2020 election .
Sanders denied the report , which was endorsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying .
Later , Warren tried to strike a conciliatory tone saying , “ Bernie is my friend , and I ’ m not here to fight with Bernie.
” However , the pair sparred over whether the year 1990 falls within the last 30 years , the period during which Warren claimed she was the only Democrat on stage who had beaten a Republican incumbent .
Sanders pointed out that he himself beat a Republican in 1990 .
At the conclusion of the debate , Sanders offered a conciliatory handshake but Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clenching them into fists as the pair exchanged a few choice words .
Candidate Tom Steyer found himself awkwardly in the firing line as the two exchanged a few more terse words after the snubbed handshake .
“ Goodnight , I ’ m out of here , ” the billionaire activist told reporters afterwards .
“ I felt like , OK , I need to move on as fast as possible.
” Needless to say , the incident sparked an outbreak of hostilities online as partisans from each side defended their favored candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others pointed out the ridiculous overanalysis of a simple handshake ( or lack thereof ) , arguing that there were far more important things to think about .
While the pair had largely stayed away from mud-slinging up to this point on the campaign trail , a recent report indicated Sanders ’ staffers had been instructed to “ go negative on Warren.

85435,"There has been a near complete drop in the number of young people addicted to heroin compared to the height of the drug epidemic which gripped inner city Dublin over two decades ago .
At the peak of the drug problem in the mid-1990s there was on average 180 adolescents treated for heroin addiction in Dublin each year .
That figure has fallen to nearly zero in recent years , according to research by two senior medical clinicians published this month in the Irish Medical Journal .
There was a 94 per cent drop in the number of 15 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2014 .
More recent figures up to last March show that downward trend had continued into the second half of the last decade , the research said .
In late 2018 , a drug programme set-up to treat young people addicted to heroin Dublin shut its doors due to a lack of new patients .
“ It was nothing to do with funding cut-backs or staff recruitment problems .
The closure occurred as the patients for whom it was designed two decades earlier had largely disappeared , ” the research stated .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby Smyth , a clinical lecturer on addiction at Trinity College Dublin , and Dr Gerry McCarney , clinical director of a Health Service Executive drug treatment programme for young people .
“ The dramatic decline in the use of heroin by adolescents in Ireland in the past 25 years has meant that specialist services for heroin dependent teenagers were no longer required in Dublin , ” the authors said .
Research looking into why young people no longer started taking heroin found the dramatic decline was linked to an extremely negative view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the 1990s .
The pattern of a sharp spike in heroin use followed by a consistent decline was seen in other countries such as England , Italy and the Netherlands .

The academics said it was remarkable that the “ near elimination of new cases of adolescent heroin dependence has been completely ignored in the on-going discourse about drug policy in Ireland ” .",1,1-2020
